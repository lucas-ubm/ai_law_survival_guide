## About me

I am a PhD candidate at the Law and Tech Lab of Maastricht University. My research focuses on approaches to ensuring the safe deployment of AI models. By approaches, I mean 

My Msc was on Artificial Intelligence and my Bsc was on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. My research before the PhD focused on varied applications to biological sciences, such as pharmacogenomic models for drug-resistance prediction, mouse behavior detection in neuroscience experiments, binge-eating episode forecasting, or genome-scale metabolic models.
